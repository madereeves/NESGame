# NES Game
### Petty Theft Kevin
This is a Summer Honors project from June 2018. We learned how a Nintendo Entertainment System worked, from how some cartridges retained memory down to the 8-bit 6502. We were a class of 10 people all working on different aspects of making a NES game. We based the game off of our class mascot, Kevin, a concrete deer lawn ornament. 

This project is far from done, but we were all pretty proud of what we accomplished in a two week time span. For some of the team, assembly was their first programming language that they have ever encountered, but they stuck with it. 

I hope to complete this project in the future.
